# CoMake
**CS Senior Project Capstone 2016-2017**, University of Colorado Boulder <br />


### Background
[CraftML](https://craftml.io/) is a 3D modeling markup language that has been used to create 3D printable tactile pictures for the visually impaired. However, it is difficult for people without prior coding experience to learn, and it is not collaborative.

### How Comake Works
Comake transforms CraftML's 3D coding workspace into a user interface that simulates a 2D interaction environment, termed 'canvas'. Users can:
  1. Arrange and modify existing CraftML models by manipulating their images in Comake
  2. Check work with a 3D previewer
  3. Generate usable CraftML code from a canvas
  4. Collaborate with users in real time
  
### Technologies
Because Comake is best used for real-time work, our stack is comprised of:
  1. **Firebase**, a real-time cloud database hosted by Google
  2. **React**, a JavaScript library for building fast and scalable websites
  3. **Redux**, a state manager for Javascript applications
  4. **Material UI**, a user interface library based on material design principles
